Chants of "Save NASA!" echoed through downtown Washington, D.C., Monday(Sept. 15) as agency workers and supporters rallied outside NASA headquarters. Carrying signs and repeating calls, protestors urged lawmakers to protect the space agency's future.

It was the third such demonstration this summer, and part of a campaign organized by NASA Needs Help that the group says is growing as the budget fight intensifies. Demonstrators warned that layoffs, mission shutdowns and the loss of union rights are already sinking morale and threatening safety across NASA centers.

Protestors argued that the agency is being hollowed out before Congress finalizes NASA's next budget, and that the damage to science and the U.S. space program could be irreparable. "Like other federal employees, the people of NASA have suffered months of attacks on their work," one protest organizer, Helen, who did not provide a last name, told the gathered crowd through a microphone. "They've endured shortsighted decisions, paralyzing uncertainty, and a steady erosion of the very expertise that makes these missions possible."

At the center of their concerns is President Donald Trump's proposed fiscal year 2026 (FY 26) budget. The White House's plan would reduce NASA's overall funding by nearly a quarter, slash science programs almost in half, and cancel 41 active or planned science missions, including spacecraft already operating in Earth orbit and beyond.

Protestors warn that those cuts threaten not just individual projects but also NASA's position as the world leader in science and innovation. Several in attendance Monday took the opportunity to address the crowd, arguing that canceling active missions wastes taxpayer dollars already spent and undermines relationships with international partners who have invested their own time and resources in such projects.

Colette Delwalla, executive director of Stand Up For Science, framed the threat as an attack on American ideology. "NASA is a tangible product of the greatest expression of the American dream," she said. "All of humanity has mused about reaching into the stars, and through decades of unified support by Congress, by presidents and the American public, we've done it. Dismantling this American institution is a travesty that no one voted for."

Delwalla argued that the U.S. is on the verge of relinquishing its global leadership in science, "in exchange for tax cuts for the ultrawealthy."

"We didn't accidentally land on the moon," Delwalla said. "We did it through unified investment in science, and we cannot separate the benefits of science from that investment."

But those benefits are already walking out the door. Since January, at least 4,000 employees have departed NASA through layoffs, early retirements and voluntary separations through the Trump administration's deferred resignation programs (DRPs). Protestors fear that includes an institutional knowledge base that may not be recoverable.

The group's pleas haven't gone unnoticed on Capitol Hill. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.), a member of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, addressed protestors Monday, telling the crowd that the people at NASA are central to U.S. leadership.
